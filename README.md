# A TypeScript Skeleton

With this repo cloned locally, run `npm install` to install your depdendencies and then get developing :thumbsup:

What's in the bag? Mostly the rough minimum (if you ask me...) for getting up and running with a barebones TypeScript project. This is the setup I've been using to learn and experiment with TypeScript: 

- TypeScript (yup!) 
- Jest 
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky and Lint-Staged for pre-commit hooks. 

Enjoy the wonderful world of static typing!
